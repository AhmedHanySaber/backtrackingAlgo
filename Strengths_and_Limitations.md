# Strengths and Limitations

## Backtracking Algorithm
### Strengths:
- Simple to implement.
- Works well for small input sizes.

### Limitations:
- Exponential time complexity for large inputs.
- Inefficient without pruning or optimization techniques.

## Tarjan's SCC Algorithm
### Strengths:
- Linear time complexity.
- Efficient for large graphs.

### Limitations:
- Requires graph representation in memory, which could be costly for sparse graphs with billions of edges.
- Not suitable for dynamic graphs where edges change frequently.

## Combined Usage
### Strengths:
- Effective for solving problems involving graph navigation and safe zone identification.
- Combines the exhaustive nature of backtracking with the efficiency of Tarjan's SCC.

### Limitations:
- Combined complexity might be high for large-scale applications.
- Requires careful design to integrate both algorithms effectively.
